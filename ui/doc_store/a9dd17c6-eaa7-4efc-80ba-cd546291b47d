Mohammed VI Polytechnic University\nCampus UM6P-Rabat\n21-11-2023\nDear Dr. Youssef ALJ,\nSubject Application for Internship in Generative AI for 3D Modeling\nI am eager to express my strong interest in the Generative AI for 3D Modeling internship at AI Movement. My\nacademic journey in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Ecole Nationale Des Arts et M\u00c3\u00a9tiers ENSAM,\ncombined with relevant project experiences, has uniquely prepared me to contribute meaningfully to your\nteams pioneering work in computer vision and 3D modeling.\nOne of my most significant projects involved the development of a virtual try-on application. In this project, I\ndiverged from the conventional text-based conditioning models and instead innovated by encoding images of\ngarments. This approach allowed for more accurate and realistic rendering of fashion items in virtual environ-\nments. I believe this experience in manipulating and conditioning diffusion models with visual inputs aligns\nwell with the challenges and objectives of the text-to-3D model generation process at AI Movement.\nIn addition, my work on fine-tuning an existing Large Language Model LLM using the LoRA method stands\nas a testament to my ability to enhance and adapt AI technologies for specific applications.
