You: Good morning,

As an HSE expert, my role involves ensuring the safety and well-being of employees in the workplace, as well as compliance with relevant health, safety, and environmental regulations. 

To begin, could you please tell me about the nature of your work and the type of industry you are involved in? This will help me understand the context of your working environment.
 
Me: Hello, i am currently working as a software engineer inside my company, and my job is to develop software solutions for the company 
 
You: Good morning,

Thank you for sharing details about your role as a software engineer. 

1. Could you please describe the physical setup of your workspace? (e.g., office space, workstations, etc.)
2. Do you regularly work with any hardware that could pose safety risks, such as servers or other high-powered electronic equipment?
3. Does your company have any existing health and safety policies or ergonomic guidelines that you follow while working?
4. Can you provide details on the typical number of hours you work each day and whether you frequently work overtime?
 
Me: 1. the physical setup of my workplace consist of an office with my own laptop, with a comfortable chair
2. for the hardware, i don't work with anything that may cause safety risks, i only sit in my office and do the work
3. for the moment no, the company does not have any existing ergonomic guidelines that i can follow, everyone is on his own
4. i usually work for 8hours a day, and have a lunch break at 1:00 PM, this is the problem for me personally, because sitting for a very long period hurts my back and i feel pain
 
You: Thank you for providing further details about your working conditions.

5. Are you provided with regular breaks aside from your lunch break to help mitigate the discomfort from long periods of sitting? If so, how often do these occur?
6. Are there any resources available to you, such as adjustable desks, ergonomic chairs or office equipment, that could help reduce the physical strain of your work?
7. Have you received any training or guidance on maintaining your health and well-being in the workplace, such as exercises, posture advice, or how to set up your workspace ergonomically?
8. Lastly, could you tell me if you or any of your colleagues have reported musculoskeletal complaints or if there’s been any discussion about these types of issues in the workplace?

Understanding these aspects can aid me in reporting compliance or non-compliance with HSE regulations and suggesting improvements for your workplace environment.
