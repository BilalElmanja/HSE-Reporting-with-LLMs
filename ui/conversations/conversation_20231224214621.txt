5. Are you provided with regular breaks aside from your lunch break to help mitigate the discomfort from long periods of sitting? If so, how often do these occur?
6. Are there any resources available to you, such as adjustable desks, ergonomic chairs or office equipment, that could help reduce the physical strain of your work?
7. Have you received any training or guidance on maintaining your health and well-being in the workplace, such as exercises, posture advice, or how to set up your workspace ergonomically?
