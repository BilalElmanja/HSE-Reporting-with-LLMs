You: Thank you for your response. As a software developer, your work situation primarily relates to an office environment. Let's discuss some aspects related to your Health, Safety, and Environmental conditions:

1. Could you describe your daily workspace setup and whether you have ergonomic equipment to prevent strain or injury?
2. Do you regularly use any chemical substances, like cleaning agents or toners, that might require safety data sheets or particular handling procedures?
3. Can you detail the emergency procedures for fire, evacuation, or other potential incidents in your workplace?
4. How does your company address mental health and stress management for its employees, considering the demanding nature of software development?
