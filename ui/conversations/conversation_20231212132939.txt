User: what is the program of the internship is about ? provide all the details 
Agent: response based on documents: 
 The program of the internship is about designing and developing deep learning models for multimodal emotion recognition, specifically focusing on speech, text, and face modalities. The goal is to create a system that can detect emotions in real-time, using various sensors and data sources, and integrate it with the robot Tiago, which is developed by the CESI LINEACT laboratory. The internship will involve conceiving and implementing architectures and loss functions specific to each modality, as well as exploring ways to optimize them. The solutions developed during the internship could potentially be integrated into the robot Tiago, enabling it to better understand human emotions and behaviors.

 Bonjour Bilal El Manja,

Thank you for introducing yourself. As a student at ENSAM's Department of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, you may be interested in the research project presented in the given text. The project focuses on developing deep learning models for multimodal emotion recognition, specifically recognizing emotions from speech, text, and face expressions.

The project involves several steps, including studying existing works, developing a system based on modalities, exploring fusion techniques, and evaluating performances. The required competencies for this project include a good understanding of machine learning methods, programming skills in Python, and mastery of PyTorch or TensorFlow libraries. Additionally, knowledge in robotics would be beneficial.

The duration of the project is six months, and it will take place at CESI's campus in Nancy. The project's goal is to develop models that can detect emotions in real-time, which could potentially be integrated into the Tiago robot, currently being developed by the CESI LINEACT laboratory.

If you are interested in this project, you can apply by submitting your CV, academic transcripts, and letters of recommendation before December 15, 2023, to Leila BEN LETAIF and Amine BOHI, the project supervisors.

Good luck with your application!
