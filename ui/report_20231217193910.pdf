Introduction:
Ibtissam El Hassani, an HSE specialist, interviewed me, a software engineer at a company, to assess the work environment and identify potential hazards, risks, or non-compliance with HSE regulations. The interview aimed to provide a thorough understanding of the current employment circumstances and ensure a secure and healthy work environment.

Findings:

1. Job Description and Duties:
As a software engineer, my duties include working for 8 hours a day in long shifts in an office setting. I am responsible for developing and maintaining software systems, collaborating with colleagues, and meeting project deadlines.
2. Work Environment:
The temperature and lighting conditions in the office are satisfactory. However, there is some noise in the office that may affect comfort and productivity levels. The break areas and restrooms are accessible and clean.
3. Health and Safety Issues:
Due to prolonged working periods, I experience back pain, which causes discomfort and affects my productivity. I have not received adequate training or resources to perform my job safely and efficiently, including ergonomics, proper lifting techniques, and emergency procedures.
4. Training and Resources:
I have not participated in any training programs or received sufficient resources to perform my job safely and efficiently. This lack of training increases the risk of work-related injuries or illnesses.
5. Accident and Incident Reporting:
There are no designated personnel or procedures in place for addressing accidents, incidents, or near misses in the workplace. I am unaware of any processes for reporting such events.
6. Safety Hazards and Violations:
I have noticed some safety hazards in the work environment, including improper waste disposal and damaged electrical cords. However, I have not reported them to management or HSE representatives due to lack of knowledge about the reporting process.

Recommendations:

1. Conduct regular health and safety training sessions for employees, focusing on ergonomics, proper lifting techniques, and emergency procedures. Provide resources and equipment to alleviate discomfort and prevent musculoskeletal problems.
2. Implement a comprehensive accident and incident reporting system, including designated personnel and clear procedures for addressing these events. Ensure all employees understand the reporting process and their roles in maintaining a safe work environment.
3. Address the identified safety hazards and violations promptly, ensuring appropriate measures are taken to prevent recurrence. Regular inspections should be conducted to identify potential risks and ensure compliance with HSE regulations.
4. Encourage employee participation in HSE matters by providing opportunities for feedback and suggestions regarding workplace safety and health concerns.
5. Develop and implement an effective training program that covers all aspects of job performance, including software engineering-specific tasks and general work practices. This will enhance productivity, efficiency, and overall work quality.

Conclusion:
The interview provided valuable insights into the current employment circumstances and highlighted areas for improvement to ensure a secure and healthy work environment. The recommended actions aim to mitigate risks, prevent work-related injuries or illnesses, and promote a culture of safety and health awareness among employees. By implementing these measures, we can create a more comfortable, efficient, and compliant work environment for all employees.
