Morocco has implemented a range of environmental policies and regulations to address various environmental challenges and promote sustainable development. Here's an overview of some of these initiatives

1. Environmental Performance Review EPR Morocco's second EPR, conducted in 2022, assessed the country's environmental governance and management. It covered areas such as legal and policy frameworks, compliance assurance mechanisms, greening the economy, environmental information and monitoring, environmental democracy, and education for sustainable development. The review also analyzed Morocco's commitment to international agreements and addressed specific issues like air protection, water management, waste and chemicals management, biodiversity and protected areas, and coastal zone management.

2. Governmental Responsibilities The Moroccan Parliament is responsible for adopting framework laws on the state's environmental activities. The Ministry of Energy, Mines, Water, and the Environment oversees sustainable development policy and strategy, environmental law development, biodiversity protection, and national environmental programs. Regions, provinces, and local governments in Morocco also play significant roles in managing natural resources, developing water and energy strategies, and promoting energy efficiency.

3.
