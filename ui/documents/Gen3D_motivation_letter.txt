Dear Dr. Youssef ALJ,
Subject Application for Internship in Generative AI for 3D Modeling
I am eager to express my strong interest in the Generative AI for 3D Modeling internship at AI Movement. My
academic journey in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Ecole Nationale Des Arts et MÃ©tiers ENSAM,
combined with relevant project experiences, has uniquely prepared me to contribute meaningfully to your
teams pioneering work in computer vision and 3D modeling.
One of my most significant projects involved the development of a virtual try-on application. In this project, I
diverged from the conventional text-based conditioning models and instead innovated by encoding images of
garments. This approach allowed for more accurate and realistic rendering of fashion items in virtual environ-
ments. I believe this experience in manipulating and conditioning diffusion models with visual inputs aligns
well with the challenges and objectives of the text-to-3D model generation process at AI Movement.
In addition, my work on fine-tuning an existing Large Language Model LLM using the LoRA method stands
as a testament to my ability to enhance and adapt AI technologies for specific applications. I applied multiple
adapters to enable the model to perform a variety of tasks and designed a user-friendly interface to facilitate its
practical application. This project underscores my skills in adapting AI models to specific tasks, a capability
that I am excited to bring to your innovative text-to-3D modeling project.
My academic background has also involved me in projects such as real-time anomaly detection in production
data and developing a control and monitoring platform for autonomous robots, further strengthening my skills
in machine learning, data analytics, and deep learning. Additionally, my proficiency in programming languages
like Python, Java, ReactJS, and NodeJS, along with my multilingual fluency, positions me well for collaborative
and interdisciplinary work.
I am enthusiastic about the possibility of joining AI Movement and contributing to the evolution of 3D modeling
technology. The opportunity to work with advanced technologies such as monocular depth estimation and
semantic segmentation is particularly compelling to me.
Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to discussing how my background, skills, and
aspirations align with the needs and vision of AI Movement. Please feel free to contact me at 212 6 10 14 08
82 or via email at elmanjabilalgmail.com to schedule a conversation.
Sincerely,
El Manja Bilal
